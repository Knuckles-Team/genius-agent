FastMCP 3.0.1
Releases
February 20, 2026
## [FastMCP v3.0.1: Three-covery Mode First patch after 3.0 — mostly smoothing out rough edges discovered in the wild. The big ones: middleware state that wasn’t surviving the trip to tool handlers now does, `Tool.from_tool()` accepts callables again, OpenAPI schemas with circular references no longer crash discovery, and decorator overloads now return the correct types in function mode.🔐 **OIDC`verify_id_token`** — New option for providers that issue opaque access tokens but standard JWT id_tokens. Verifies identity via the id_token while using the access_token for upstream API calls.🐞 **11 bug fixes** — State serialization, future annotations with `Context`/`Depends`, OpenAI handler deprecation warnings, type checker compatibility, and more.

FastMCP 3.0.0
Releases
February 18, 2026
[![release-3-0](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fastmcp/assets/updates/release-3-0.png) FastMCP v3.0.0: Three at Last FastMCP 3.0 is stable. Two betas, two release candidates, 21 new contributors, and more than 100,000 pre-release installs later — the architecture held up, the upgrade path was smooth, and we’re shipping it.The surface API is largely unchanged — `@mcp.tool()` still works exactly as before. What changed is everything underneath: a provider/transform architecture that makes FastMCP extensible, observable, and composable in ways v2 couldn’t support.🔌 **Build servers from anything** — `FileSystemProvider`, `OpenAPIProvider`, `ProxyProvider`, `SkillsProvider`, and composable transforms that rename, namespace, filter, version, and secure components as they flow to clients.🔐 **Ship to production** — Component versioning, granular authorization with async auth checks, CIMD, Static Client Registration, Azure OBO, OpenTelemetry tracing, and background tasks with distributed Redis notification.💾 **Adapt per session** — Session state persists across requests, and `ctx.enable_components()` / `ctx.disable_components()` let servers adapt dynamically per client.⚡ **Develop faster** — `--reload`, standalone decorators, automatic threadpool dispatch, tool timeouts, pagination, and concurrent tool execution.🖥️ **CLI** — `fastmcp list`, `fastmcp call`, `fastmcp discover`, `fastmcp generate-cli`, and `fastmcp install` for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Goose.

FastMCP 3.0.0rc1
Releases
February 12, 2026
## [FastMCP v3.0.0rc1: RC-ing is Believing FastMCP 3 RC1 means we believe the API is stable. Beta 2 drew a wave of real-world adoption — production deployments, migration reports, integration testing — and the feedback overwhelmingly confirmed that the architecture works. This release closes gaps that surfaced under load: auth flows that needed to be async, background tasks that needed reliable notification delivery, and APIs still carrying beta-era naming. If nothing unexpected surfaces, this is what 3.0.0 looks like.🚨 **Breaking Changes** — The `ui=` parameter is now `app=` with a unified `AppConfig` class, and 16 `FastMCP()` constructor kwargs have been removed after months of deprecation warnings.🔐 **Auth Improvements** — Async `auth=` checks, Static Client Registration for servers without DCR, and declarative Azure OBO flows via dependency injection.⚡ **Concurrent Sampling** — `context.sample()` can now execute multiple tool calls in parallel with `tool_concurrency=0`.📡 **Background Task Notifications** — A distributed Redis queue replaces polling for progress updates and elicitation relay.✅ **OpenAPI Output Validation** — `validate_output=False` disables strict schema checking for imperfect backend APIs.

FastMCP 3.0.0b2
Releases
February 7, 2026
## [FastMCP v3.0.0b2: 2 Fast 2 Beta Beta 2 reflects the huge number of people that kicked the tires on Beta 1. Seven new contributors landed changes, and early migration reports went smoother than expected. Most of Beta 2 is refinement — fixing what people found, filling gaps from real usage, hardening edges — but a few new features landed along the way.🖥️ **Client CLI** — `fastmcp list`, `fastmcp call`, `fastmcp discover`, and `fastmcp generate-cli` turn any MCP server into something you can poke at from a terminal.🔐 **CIMD** (Client ID Metadata Documents) adds an alternative to Dynamic Client Registration for OAuth.📱 **MCP Apps** — Spec-level compliance for the MCP Apps extension with `ui://` resource scheme and typed UI metadata.⏳ **Background Task Context** — `Context` now works transparently in Docket workers with Redis-based coordination.🛡️ **ResponseLimitingMiddleware** caps tool response sizes with UTF-8-safe truncation.🪿 **Goose Integration** — `fastmcp install goose` for one-command server installation into Goose.

FastMCP 3.0.0b1
Releases
January 20, 2026
## [FastMCP 3.0.0b1: This Beta Work FastMCP 3.0 rebuilds the framework around three primitives: components, providers, and transforms. Providers source components dynamically—from decorators, filesystems, OpenAPI specs, remote servers, or anywhere else. Transforms modify components as they flow to clients. The features that required specialized subsystems in v2 now compose naturally from these building blocks.🔌 **Provider Architecture** unifies how components are sourced with `FileSystemProvider`, `SkillsProvider`, `OpenAPIProvider`, and `ProxyProvider`.🔄 **Transforms** add middleware for components—namespace, rename, filter by version, control visibility.📋 **Component Versioning** lets you register multiple versions of the same tool with automatic highest-version selection.💾 **Session-Scoped State** persists across requests, with per-session visibility control.⚡ **DX Improvements** include `--reload` for development, automatic threadpool dispatch, tool timeouts, pagination, and OpenTelemetry tracing.

FastMCP 2.13.0
Releases
October 25, 2025
## [FastMCP 2.13.0: Cache Me If You Can FastMCP 2.13 “Cache Me If You Can” represents a fundamental maturation of the framework. After months of community feedback on authentication and state management, this release delivers the infrastructure FastMCP needs to handle production workloads: persistent storage, response caching, and pragmatic OAuth improvements that reflect real-world deployment challenges.💾 **Pluggable storage backends** bring persistent state to FastMCP servers. Built on [py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value), a new library from FastMCP maintainer Bill Easton ([@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate)), the storage layer provides encrypted disk storage by default, platform-aware token management, and a simple key-value interface for application state. We’re excited to bring this elegantly designed library into the FastMCP ecosystem - it’s both powerful and remarkably easy to use, including wrappers to add encryption, TTLs, caching, and more to backends ranging from Elasticsearch, Redis, DynamoDB, filesystem, in-memory, and more!🔐 **OAuth maturity** brings months of production learnings into the framework. The new consent screen prevents confused deputy and authorization bypass attacks discovered in earlier versions, while the OAuth proxy now issues its own tokens with automatic key derivation. RFC 7662 token introspection support enables enterprise auth flows, and path prefix mounting enables OAuth-protected servers to integrate into existing web applications. FastMCP now supports out-of-the-box authentication with [WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos) and [AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit), [GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github), [Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google), [Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure) (Entra ID), [AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito), [Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0), [Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope), [Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit), [JWTs](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#jwt-token-verification), and [RFC 7662 token introspection](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#token-introspection-protocol).⚡ **Response Caching Middleware** dramatically improves performance for expensive operations, while **Server lifespans** provide proper initialization and cleanup hooks that run once per server instance instead of per client session.✨ **Developer experience improvements** include Pydantic input validation, icon support, RFC 6570 query parameters for resource templates, improved Context API methods, and async file/directory resources.

Combined with the new `File` utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance.

You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code.This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamseaston_huge-thanks-to-william-easton-for-providing-activity-7338011349525983232-Mw6T?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAd6d0B3uL9zpCsq9eYWKi3HIvb8eN_r_Q), “Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools.”🏷️ Component ControlNow that you’re transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who’s been asking what FastMCP’s tags are for—they finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.🚀 Pragmatic by DefaultLastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we’ve made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we’ll restore the old default — but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

```
In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated. Read the release notes ](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ⇄ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use `FastMCP.from_client()` to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy.
